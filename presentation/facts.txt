		When thermography is added to a woman's regular breast health checkups, a 61% increased survival rate was realized, and when used as part of a multi-modal approach (clinical examination, mammography and thermography) 95% of early stage cancers will be detected.

In a 2008 study published in the American Journal of Surgery, performed at New York Presbyterian Hospital Cornell, 58 of 60 tumors were properly identified as malignant yielding 97% sensitivity for thermography.

An abnormal thermogram is 10 times more significant as a future risk indicator of breast cancer than a first order family history of the disease.
